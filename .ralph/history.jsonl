{"ts":"2026-02-11T18:11:33.835488Z","type":{"kind":"loop_started","prompt":"# Bun v1.3.8 Source-Build Orchestration\n\n## Objective\nIterate on a Homebrew/core **source build** of Bun v1.3.8 with strict constraints:\n- No bootstrap bun/zig/webkit binaries.\n- No build-time downloads / git clones / `bun install`.\n- Prefer system/Homebrew deps.\n- No “resource everything.”\n\n## Loop\nOn each iteration:\n1. Run the loop script:\n   - `tools/bun_loop.sh`\n2. Read the latest summary:\n   - `logs/bun/summary-*.txt` (most recent timestamp)\n3. If summary contains `SUCCESS`:\n   - Mark `- [x] TASK_COMPLETE` below and stop.\n4. If summary contains `NETWORK_ACTIVITY_DETECTED`:\n   - Identify the exact trigger (file path + command).\n   - Add a minimal fail-fast guard or a `USE_SYSTEM_*` switch to prevent downloads.\n   - Prefer CMake options over large refactors.\n5. If summary contains a compile or configure error:\n   - Patch the minimal CMake or source file to resolve the **first** failure only.\n   - Do not preemptively fix unrelated issues.\n6. Commit after each iteration:\n   - `git add` changed files\n   - `git commit -m \"bun: prototype <short change>\"`\n\n## Guardrails\n- Keep diffs minimal and surgical.\n- Do not add Homebrew allowlists or large resource closures.\n- Do not modify unrelated formulae.\n- Keep patches in `Formula/b/bun.rb` unless absolutely necessary elsewhere.\n\n## Files of Interest\n- Formula: `Formula/b/bun.rb`\n- Status doc: `docs/bun-1.3.8-status.md`\n- Loop script: `tools/bun_loop.sh`\n\n## Stop Conditions\nStop and report if any of the following remain unavoidable without upstream changes:\n- Codegen requires bun with no alternative generator.\n- Zig download is hard-coded.\n- Dependencies are only available via git-clone at build time.\n- WebKit cannot be built locally with the expected headers/derived sources.\n\n## Completion Marker\nLOOP_COMPLETE\n"}}
